## Docs

You can ignore the docs directory, as it houses files like this one, that only help to explain or provide information about the bot and its usage.

## Private

Here all your private data is stored, for example your discord token inside the `token.txt` file. Do not send any of these files to people whom you do not fully trust.

If you have leaked your discord bot token, please reset it immediately at the [discord developer portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)!

## Public

This directory houses the files and configs, that do not have sensitive information. Configurations for embed colours and several command resources can be found here.

## Src

This is the source code directory. As the name tells you, this has all `.nim` source files, that the compiler uses to compile to a single executable.
